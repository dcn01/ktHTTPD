# ktHTTPD

A very basic and lightweight HTTP server developed with Kotlin and targeting Android/JVM.

Inspired in NanoHTTPD but using Kotlin features.
Makes use of Coroutines to handle asynchronous tasks like handling requests.
Will eventually be published as a library for use in other projects.

## Still in very early stages of development and will probably never be RFC compliant.
